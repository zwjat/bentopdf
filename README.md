## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run pdfup locally for development or personal use.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for containerized setup)

### 🚀 Quick Start with Docker

[![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates/K4AU2B)

You can run pdfup directly from Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry without cloning the repository:

You can also watch the video on how to set it up 👉
[pdfup Docker Setup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C4eJ2nqeaH__1Tlad-xuBHaF2Ha4fSBf/view?usp=drive_link)

**Using Docker Hub:**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:8080 pdfup/pdfup:latest
```

**Using GitHub Container Registry:**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:8080 ghcr.io/alam00000/pdfup:latest
```

Open your browser at: http://localhost:3000

This is the fastest way to try pdfup without setting up a development environment.

### 🏠 Self-Hosting

Since pdfup is fully client-side, all processing happens in the user's browser and no server-side processing is required. This means you can host pdfup as simple static files on any web server or hosting platform.

**Download from Releases (Recommended):**

The easiest way to self-host is to download the pre-built distribution file from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/alam00000/pdfup/releases). Each release includes a `dist-{version}.zip` file that contains all necessary files for self-hosting.

1. Go to [pdfup Releases](https://github.com/alam00000/pdfup/releases)
2. Download the latest `dist-{version}.zip` file
3. Extract the zip file
4. Serve the extracted folder with your preferred web server
   
**Serve the extracted folder (requires Node.js):**

```bash
# Navigate to the extracted folder
cd dist-1.7.3  # Replace with your version

# Start a local server
npx http-server -c-1
```

The website will be accessible at: `http://localhost:8080/`

> **Note:** The `-c-1` flag disables caching for development.

**Build from Source (Advanced):**

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alam00000/pdfup.git
cd pdfup

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Package the distribution for hosting (optional)
npm run package

# Preview the build locally
npm run preview

# The website will be accessible at: http://localhost:4173/

```

**Subdirectory Hosting:**

pdfup can also be hosted from a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/tools/pdfup/`):

```bash

# Example:
# 1. Build the app with the specific BASE_URL. BASE_URL must have a trailing and leading slash. The BASE_URL can be any url of your choice. Here we are using /tools/pdfup/ as an example.

BASE_URL=/tools/pdfup/ npm run build

# 2. Create the nested directory structure inside serve-test (or any folder of your choice for local testing. In case of production, create the nested directory structure inside the root directory)
mkdir -p serve-test/tools/pdfup

# 3. Copy all files from the 'dist' folder into that nested directory
cp -r dist/* serve-test/tools/pdfup/

# 4. Serve the 'serve-test' folder
npx serve serve-test
```

The website can be accessible at: ```http://localhost:3000/tools/pdfup/```

The `npm run package` command creates a `dist-{version}.zip` file that you can use for self-hosting.

**Docker Subdirectory Deployment:**

pdfup's Docker image also supports the `BASE_URL` build argument for subdirectory deployments:

```bash
# Build for subdirectory deployment
docker build --build-arg BASE_URL=/pdfup/ -t pdfup .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:8080 pdfup

# The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/pdfup/
```

**Combined with Simple Mode:**

```bash
# Build with both BASE_URL and SIMPLE_MODE
docker build \
  --build-arg BASE_URL=/tools/pdf/ \
  --build-arg SIMPLE_MODE=true \
  -t pdfup-simple .

docker run -p 3000:8080 pdfup-simple
```

> **Important**: 
> - Always include trailing slashes in `BASE_URL` (e.g., `/pdfup/` not `/pdfup`)
> - The default value is `/` for root deployment

### 🚀 Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

For a more robust setup with auto-restart capabilities:

1. **Download the repo and create a `docker-compose.yml` file or use the one given in repo**:

```yaml
services:
  pdfup:
    image: pdfup/pdfup:latest
    container_name: pdfup
    ports:
      - '3000:8080'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. **Start the application**:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 🏢 Simple Mode for Internal Use

For organizations that want a clean, distraction-free interface focused solely on PDF tools, pdfup supports a **Simple Mode** that hides all branding and marketing content.

**What Simple Mode does:**

- Hides navigation, hero section, features, FAQ, testimonials, and footer
- Shows only the essential PDF tools
- Updates page title to "PDF Tools"
- Perfect for internal company tools and educational institutions

For more details, see [SIMPLE_MODE.md](SIMPLE_MODE.md).

### 🔒 Security Features

pdfup runs as a non-root user using nginx-unprivileged for enhanced security:

- **Non-Root Execution**: Container runs with minimal privileges using nginx-unprivileged
- **Port 8080**: Uses high port number to avoid requiring root privileges
- **Security Best Practices**: Follows Principle of Least Privilege

#### Basic Usage

```bash
docker build -t pdfup .
docker run -p 8080:8080 pdfup
```

For detailed security configuration, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### 📦 Version Management

pdfup supports semantic versioning with multiple Docker tags available on both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry:

**Docker Hub:**

- **Latest**: `pdfup/pdfup:latest`
- **Specific Version**: `pdfup/pdfup:1.0.0`
- **Version with Prefix**: `pdfup/pdfup:v1.0.0`

**GitHub Container Registry:**

- **Latest**: `ghcr.io/alam00000/pdfup:latest`
- **Specific Version**: `ghcr.io/alam00000/pdfup:1.0.0`
- **Version with Prefix**: `ghcr.io/alam00000/pdfup:v1.0.0`

#### Quick Release

```bash
# Release a patch version (0.0.1 → 0.0.2)
npm run release

# Release a minor version (0.0.1 → 0.1.0)
npm run release:minor

# Release a major version (0.0.1 → 1.0.0)
npm run release:major
```

For detailed release instructions, see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

### 🚀 Development Setup

#### Option 1: Run with npm

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alam00000/pdfup.git
   cd pdfup
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Option 2: Build and Run with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alam00000/pdfup.git
   cd pdfup
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

   > **Note:** After making any local changes to the code, rebuild the Docker image using:
