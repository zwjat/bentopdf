## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** means the individual who is signing this Agreement and submitting Contributions to the Project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Project.

**"Project"** means the pdfup software project and all associated repositories, documentation, and related materials maintained at https://github.com/alam00000/pdfup.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Owner and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works
- Sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties
- **Relicense Your Contributions under any license**, including but not limited to proprietary licenses, commercial licenses, or any other open source license

This grant specifically enables the Project Owner to offer commercial licenses of the Project incorporating Your Contributions, consistent with the Project's dual licensing model (AGPL-3.0 for open source use, and a separate commercial license for proprietary use).

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Owner and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Project to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:

a) **Authority**: You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Project.

b) **Originality**: Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contributions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

c) **No Conflicting Obligations**: Your Contribution does not violate any agreement or obligation You have with any third party.

d) **Accuracy**: All information You provide in connection with this Agreement and Your Contributions is accurate and complete.

## 5. Moral Rights Waiver

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You hereby waive, and agree not to assert, any and all moral rights You may have in or relating to Your Contributions, including without limitation:

- The right of attribution

- The right to object to derogatory treatment
- Any similar rights existing under the laws of any jurisdiction

You acknowledge that the Project Owner may modify, adapt, translate, or otherwise change Your Contributions without Your consent and without attribution.

## 6. No Revocation

**This license grant is irrevocable.** Once You have submitted a Contribution under this Agreement, You may not revoke or withdraw the licenses granted herein. The Project Owner and all downstream recipients may continue to use, distribute, modify, and sublicense Your Contribution indefinitely.

## 7. Retention of Copyright

You retain all right, title, and interest in and to the copyright of Your Contributions. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to transfer ownership of Your Contributions to the Project Owner. You are free to use Your Contributions for any other purpose.
