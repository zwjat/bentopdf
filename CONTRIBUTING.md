### For Corporate Contributors

If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, your organization needs to sign our [Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)](CCLA.md). Please contact us at [contact@pdfup.org](mailto:contact@pdfup.org) to arrange corporate CLA signing.

### What the CLA Grants

By signing the CLA, you:

- Grant us a broad copyright license to use, modify, and relicense your contributions (including for commercial use)
- Grant a patent license for any patents covering your contribution
- Represent that you have the authority to make the contribution
